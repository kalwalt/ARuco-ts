# ARuco-ts
 A typescript version of the [js-aruco](https://github.com/jcmellado/js-aruco) library. It implements most of the features, but it is yet in a early stage.
 Actually it only support 5x5 markers, more types will be added in a near future.
 
## Examples

Try one of the examples in the examples folder: 
- simple.html
- webcam_example.html

## Future development

- use [speedy-vision](https://github.com/alemart/speedy-vision) for image manipulations routines (grayscale conversion, blurring...).
- add a Dictionary, so it will support other markers types.
